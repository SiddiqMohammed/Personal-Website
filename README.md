# Personal-Website
Creating my personal website from scratch

Making a personal website akin to the one made by Devon Crawford. This project is my first attempt at building a website from scratch without any help from Wordpress and the like. 

Initially I'm going to copy Devon's website as closely as possible and then use it as a base and build more upon it using the acquired skills.

The final goal of this project is to make a minimal yet dynamic website that showcases my skills in the best way possible.

In the middle of the project I've decided that I'll write updates of each day in bullet points in order to discipline myself

Used Lightbox for the image slideshow shince I don't know JS good enough yet. Will delete lightbox later when I make my own version of it or at least close to it from scratch.

- added lightbox to showcase my photos

- added "recent projects" section before the services section
- added table of recent project
- added a "view more projects" button at the end of the popular projects section
- changed main-text to reflect myself better
- each profession in the main-text has a navigational link to its corresponding section
- fixed the "click here button" for relative screen sizes [kinda]
- added vw for fonts instead of px for main text areas
