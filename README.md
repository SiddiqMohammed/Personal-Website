# Personal-Website
Creating my personal website from scratch

Making a personal website akin to the one made by Devon Crawford. This project is my first attempt at building a website from scratch without any help from Wordpress and the like. 

Initially I'm going to copy Devon's website as closely as possible and then use it as a base and build more upon it using the acquired skills.

The final goal of this project is to make a minimal yet dynamic website that showcases my skills in the best way possible.
